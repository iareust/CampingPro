# CampingPro

## Project Description
In the project CampingPro a simple web application for planning camping holidays in Switzerland was implemented using Django, Leaflet and PostGIS. The user should be able to filter campsites according to their proximity to lakes and rivers as well as distances to train stations. For the filtered campsites, information such as name and contact details should be available to the user. Additionally, pgRouting was used to add a pathfinding functionality that shows the user the shortest route from any point in Switzerland to a selected station via the Swiss rail network. 

The following datasets served as the data basis for the application:
- Swiss lakes and rivers 
- Swiss campsites
- Swiss public transpor stops
- SBB rail network
